# Libft

My own representation of stdlib and even more, enjoy :)

## Scheme
- [Subject](#subject)
+ [Usage](#usage)


# Subject
Write my own stdlib, but with some code-style requirements (see norme.en.pdf file). So, if you see something strange.. it's code-style requirements :D

# Usage

You need to have Make utility and gcc compiler.. or compiled by hands :D
Open libft folder and run
```console
make
```
Congratulations, mortal! You'v got libft.a library, now you can just append it while compling your program.
```console
gcc -o exec_name file1.c file2.c libft.a
```
